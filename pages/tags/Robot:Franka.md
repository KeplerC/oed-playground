In the second task, the robot presses the dough with a circle press / square press / circle punch / square punch. In the third task, the robot rolls the dough with a large roller / small roller.
- [RoboSet](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/roboset.md): "The robot interacts with different objects in kitchen scenes. It performs articulated object manipulation of objects with prismatic joints and hinges. It wipes tables with cloth. It performs pick and place skills, and skills requiring precision like capping and uncapping."
- [Furniture_Bench](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/furniture_bench_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot assembles one of 9 3D-printed furniture models on the table, which requires grasping, inserting, and screwing.
- [QUT_Dexterous_Manpulation](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/qut_dexterous_manpulation.md): The robot performs some tasks in a tabletop setting. It sorts dishes and objects, cooks and serves food, sets the table, throws away trash paper, rolls dices, waters plants, stacks toy blocks.
- [Maniskill](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/niskill_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot interacts with different objects placed on the plane (ground).
