# Expert_Policy

- [CMU_Franka_Exploration](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/cmu_franka_exploration_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): Franka exploring kitchen environment, lifting knife and vegetable and opening cabinet.
- [KAIST_Nonprehensile_Objects](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/kaist_nonprehensile_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot performs various non-prehensile manipulation tasks in a tabletop environment. It translates and reorients diverse real-world and 3d-printed objects to a target 6dof pose.
- [SACSoN](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/berkeley_gnm_sac_son.md): Mobile robot navigates pedestrian-rich environments (e.g. offices, school buildings etc.) and runs a learned policy that may interact with the pedestrians.
- [DLR_Sara_Pour_Dataset](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/dlr_sara_pour_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot learns to pour ping-pong balls from a cup held in the end-effector into the cup placed on the table.
- [CMU_Stretch](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/cmu_stretch.md): Robot interacting with different household environments.
- [DLR_Sara_Grid_Clamp_Dataset](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/dlr_sara_grid_clamp_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot learns to place the grid clamp in the grids on the table.
- [Saytap](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/utokyo_saytap_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): A Unitree Go1 robot follows human command in natural language (e.g., "trot forward slowly")
- [QT-Opt](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/kuk.md): Kuka robot picking objects in a bin.
- [LSMO_Dataset](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/tokyo_u_lsmo_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot avoids obstacle on the table and reaches the target object.
- [CoryHall](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/berkeley_gnm_cory_h.md): Small mobile robot navigates hallways in an office building using a learned policy.
- [ETH_Agent_Affordances](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/eth_agent_affordances.md): The robot opens and closes an oven, starting from different initial positions and door angles.
- [UCSD_Pick_Place](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/ucsd_pick_and_place_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot performs pick and place tasks in table top and kitchen scenes. The dataset contains a variety of visual variations.
- [Stanford_Kuka_Multimodal](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/stanford_kuka_multimodal_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot learns to insert differently-shaped pegs into differently-shaped holes with low tolerances (~2mm).
