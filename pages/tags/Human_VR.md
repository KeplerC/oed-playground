It opens/closes the microwave door, opens/closes the oven door, turns the stove knobs, and moves the pot between the stove and the sink.
- [CMU_Play_Fusion](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/cmu_play_fusion.md): The robot plays with 3 complex scenes: a grill with many cooking objects like toaster, pan, etc. It has to pick, open, place, close. It  has to set a table, move plates, cups, utensils. And it has to place dishes in the sink, dishwasher, hand cups etc. 
- [FMB](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/fmb.md): The robot interacts with diverse 3D printed objects, pick them up, reposition, and assemble them
- [Columbia_PushT_Dataset](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/columbia_cairlab_pusht_re.md): The robot pushes a T-shaped block into a fixed goal pose, and then move to an fixed exit zone.
- [RoboSet](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/roboset.md): "The robot interacts with different objects in kitchen scenes. It performs articulated object manipulation of objects with prismatic joints and hinges. It wipes tables with cloth. It performs pick and place skills, and skills requiring precision like capping and uncapping."
- [Furniture_Bench](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/furniture_bench_dataset_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The robot assembles one of 9 3D-printed furniture models on the table, which requires grasping, inserting, and screwing.

- [USC_Jaco_Play](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/jaco_p.md): The robot performs pick-place tasks in a tabletop toy kitchen environment. Some examples of the task include, "Pick up the orange fruit.", "Put the black bowl in the sink."
- [QUT_Dexterous_Manpulation](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/qut_dexterous_manpulation.md): The robot performs some tasks in a tabletop setting. It sorts dishes and objects, cooks and serves food, sets the table, throws away trash paper, rolls dices, waters plants, stacks toy blocks.
- [BC-Z](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/bc_z.md): The robot attempts picking, wiping, and placing tasks on a diverse set of objects on a tabletop, along with a few challenging tasks like stacking cups on top of each other.
- [Freiburg_Franka_Play](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/taco_p.md): "The robot interacts with toy blocks, it pick and places them, stacks them, unstacks them, opens drawers, sliding doors and turrns on LED lights by pushing buttons."
- [Tokyo_PR2_Tabletop_Manipulation](oed-playground/tree/master/pages/datasets/utokyo_pr2_tabletop_manipulation_converted_externally_to_rlds.md): The PR2 robot conducts manipulation for table top object. It conducts pick-and-place of bread and grape and folds cloth.
